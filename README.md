## 🌟 Project Impact & Vision
Raw crime data is often inaccessible and difficult for the general public or policymakers to interpret. This project transforms over **432,000 rows** of German Federal Police (PKS) data into a high-performance interactive dashboard to ensure accurate data evaluation and transparency.

### Why this project?
- **Problem Solved:** Traditional statistical reports are static PDFs. This tool allows users to drill down into specific districts (*Landkreise*), crime categories, and demographics in real-time.
- **Goal:** To provide a transparent, data-driven view of public safety trends in Germany for the years 2023 and 2024.
- **Key Learnings:** - **Big Data Optimization:** Implementing SQL indexing (`idx_master_covering`) to reduce query times from several seconds to milliseconds, mitigating critical performance risks.
  - **Data Integrity:** Solving complex encoding issues (UTF-8 vs. Latin1) to correctly render German *Umlaute* like "Köln" or "Baden-Württemberg".
  - **Risk Management:** Utilizing a structured Risk Board to proactively address technical debt, port conflicts (Risk #12), and communication gaps (Risk #5).
